# Supervised Learning Method

This is the pipeline for generating the different stages of the supervised learning approach. The supervised learning stages are divided into three main branches.
* The first branch corresponds to the synthetic data generation, where the number of signals is given, as well as the different constraints for the signal generation. Run ``` python data_generation.py ``` to replicate the data used to generate the results from the thesis.
* The second stage refers to training the model of the supervised learning approach. This training uses TensorFlow; therefore, this library and some others are needed to train the model. Run ``` python train.py signals.npy dists.npy angles.npy ``` to train the model, feel free to change the data path according to your needs.
* The last stage is testing the model with real or synthetic data and obtaining the $MWF$ and $T_{2}$ maps and the flip angle for a certain volume. This replicates the parts mentioned in chapters 3 and 4 of the thesis work. To use the testing module, run ``` python test.py --input_volume (volume name) --mask (mask name) ``` by default mask name is set to ''. The inference will only be computed in the mask region if a mask is provided.
