This folder contains a registration pipeline based on the MCFLIRT implementation from the FSL library, along with processing tools from MRTRIX. The pipeline computes a bias field and corrects the images accordingly. Echo alignment is performed using the first echo as the reference. However, a drawback of this approach is that while the echoes are correctly aligned, there is a mismatch between different echo times, resulting in noisier signals due to movement between echoes. Although this is the most refined method for registering images using MRTRIX and FSL, the authors of these codes recommend using the ANTs registration software for better alignment.
